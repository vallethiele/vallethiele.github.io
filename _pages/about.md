I am a first year PhD student of [Rong Zhou](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~rz240/) at the University of Cambridge. Previously, I completed the Master's programmes at Bonn and Cambridge.


I am interested in arithmetic geometry.


My Master's thesis (supervised by Peter Scholze):  
[Tempered holomorphic functions in analytic geometry](https://vallethiele.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf)
